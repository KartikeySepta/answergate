STEP 5: VECTOR STORE

Wraps Qdrant behind a small interface so nothing else in the project calls Qdrant
directly — if you ever swap vector stores, this is the only file that changes.

THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST IN THIS FILE:
Every chunk stored here carries a workspace_id in its payload, and every search
is FILTERED by workspace_id. This is what stops one research topic's videos from
leaking into another topic's answers. It's tested explicitly below — two fake
workspaces, and a query in workspace A must NEVER return workspace B's data.

Uses Qdrant's local mode by default (a file on disk, no server needed) — good for
solo/small-scale use. Switch to a server URL later only if you actually need it.
